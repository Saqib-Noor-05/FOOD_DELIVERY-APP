Food Delivery Web App

I developed this project as a food delivery website clone to understand how modern online ordering platforms work. The goal was to design a clean and user-friendly interface where users can browse food items, add them to a cart, and experience a simple ordering flow.

Through this project, I practiced important React concepts such as component-based architecture, Context API for state management, routing, reusable layouts, and responsive design. It helped me gain hands-on experience in building a real-world web application.
